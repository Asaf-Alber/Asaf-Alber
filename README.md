## 📂 Projects
Here are some selected academic and personal projects I've worked on:

### ⏱️ Arduino Stopwatch & Countdown Timer
A real-time embedded system built with Arduino Uno, I²C LCD, and buzzer.  
Supports stopwatch & countdown modes with:
- Mode selection menu (button controlled)
- Countdown time setting via buttons
- Buzzer alerts every 30 seconds & on timeout
- Animated blinking colon on LCD
- Long-press reset to return to menu

### 🛰️ RF Circuit Simulation & Analysis
Designed and simulated RF modules using OrCAD with lab validation using oscilloscopes and signal generators.

### ⚙️ VLSI Logic Design
Designed CMOS gates and combinational logic in Cadence Virtuoso with LVS and DRC validation.

### 📐 High-Frequency PCB Layout
Designed 2-layer and 4-layer PCBs for high-speed applications using EasyEDA, including signal integrity analysis.

## 💡 Fun Fact
I transitioned from leading over 100 employees at a telecom company to designing low-noise amplifiers in a lab.  
Always pushing boundaries — from call centers to circuit boards.
