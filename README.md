# Hi there , I'm Asaf Alber

 I'm a 3rd-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Tel Aviv University.  
 I love building hardware systems, from high-frequency PCB design to CMOS logic simulation.  
 Currently learning and growing in analog/digital circuit design, VLSI, and embedded systems.

## 📂 Projects
Here are some selected academic and personal projects I've worked on:

### 🛰️ RF Circuit Simulation & Analysis  
Designed and simulated RF modules using OrCAD with lab validation using oscilloscopes and signal generators.

### ⚙️ VLSI Logic Design  
Designed CMOS gates and combinational logic in Cadence Virtuoso with LVS and DRC validation.

### 🔍 Logic Probe PCB v1.0  
Designed and built a digital logic probe capable of identifying LOW, HIGH, or PWM signals on digital lines.  
Utilized voltage reference dividers, comparators, and RC filtering to classify signals with LED feedback.  
Simulated the analog behavior and implemented a compact PCB layout in EasyEDA.  

### ⏱️ Arduino Stopwatch & Countdown Timer  
Created an embedded system using Arduino Uno, LCD (I²C), and buzzer for stopwatch and countdown timer modes.  
Features real-time control with button-based UX and state-machine logic.

## 💡 Fun Fact  
I transitioned from leading over 100 employees at a telecom company to designing low-noise amplifiers in a lab.  
Always pushing boundaries — from call centers to circuit boards.
